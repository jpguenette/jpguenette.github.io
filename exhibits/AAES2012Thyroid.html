	BACKGROUND: Local well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WTC) recurrences are often difficult to treat surgically and distant metastases may arise in difficult-to-treat locations. We report our long-term results using image-guided ablation as treatment for
recurrent and metastatic WTC.<br><br>

METHOD: Thirty-five recurrent WTC neck lateral compartment lesions were treated in 19 patients. Of the 35 lesions, 19 were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 16 with ethanol ablation (EtOH). All patients previously had modified neck dissection performed by a single experienced endocrine surgeon. Data points included tumor recurrence, pre- and post-operative serum thyroglobulin (Tg),
and procedural complications. Patients were followed with routine US or CT, 131I whole body scan, and/or serum Tg levels. Eleven distant focal metastases were treated in 8 patients. Two lesions were treated in the clavicle, sternum, and lung, while one lesion
was treated in the humerus, 7th rib, sacrum, liver, and kidney. Methods of treatment included RFA for 7 lesions, microwave ablation for 2, and cryoablation for 2. Data points included tumor recurrence at the ablation site and procedural complications.<br><br>

RESULTS: Mean follow-up for treatment of neck lesions was 47.6 months. No recurrent disease was detected in the 19 lesions treated with RFA (mean size: 1.6cm; range: 0.5-3.7cm). Recurrent disease was detected in 3 of the 16 lesions treated with EtOH (mean size:
1.1cm; range: 0.5-1.5cm). One of these recurrences was successfully treated with RFA, two were successfully retreated with EtOH. Permanent vocal cord paralysis occurred following one RFA procedure of a lateral compartment supraclavicular node. Tg levels
were available for 9 of the 19 patients treated with neck ablation. In these patients, Tg levels decreased to or remained at undetectable or low detectable levels following ablation. Two of the 11 distant focal metastases recurred and were successfully
retreated with RFA, the remainder showed no sign of recurrence or disease progression at the treatment site at last follow-up (mean: 29.5 months; range: 7-60 months) and there were no treatment complications of distant focal lesions.<br><br>

CONCLUSION: Image-guided ablation is a safe and feasible treatment option for locally recurrent WTC following adequate surgery as well as for distant focal WTC metastases. Our results suggest that RFA is more effective than EtOH for local neck lesions despite being used to treat larger lesions.
